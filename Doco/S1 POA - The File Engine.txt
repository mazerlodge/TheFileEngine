S1 POA - The File Engine 

Goal - Create a python app that copies files found in a powershell produce text file to a flash drive. 

>Reference 
------------
File produced from powershell script as follows:
dir -recurse | ? {$_.lastwritetime -gt '6/1/18' -AND $_.lastwritetime -lt '6/30/18'} | out-file -encoding UTF8 c:\outputdir\modlistyyyymmdd.txt

Note: Obsolete version produced UTF16 LE file encoding, causing issues with python code reading the file.
