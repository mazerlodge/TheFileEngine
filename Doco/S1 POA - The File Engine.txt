S1 POA - The File Engine 

Goal - Create a python app that copies files found in a powershell produce text file to a flash drive. 

>Reference 
------------
File produced from powershell script as follows:
dir -recurse | ? {$_.lastwritetime -gt '1/1/19' -AND $_.lastwritetime -lt '6/30/19'} | out-file -encoding UTF8 c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt
	Note: For current period, use tomorrow's date for -lt parameter.
	Note: Obsolete version produced UTF16 LE file encoding, causing issues with python code reading the file.

NOTE: When cascading backups, use earliest capture date from upstream backup to avoid dropping files between cascade steps.

Process (in powershell):
0) Create target bup folder c:\temp\HOSTNAMEBupyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd 
1) cd to source folder, Run above 'dir -recurse...' command, output to c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt with dates in month range. 
2) Remove .pst file from bup (too big)
3) Search for NoArchive.txt file, remove folders containing this (m/b too big) 
4) cd to TFE project directory, source folder. 
5) Run python tfe.py -action genscript -infile c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt -targetpath c:\temp\HOSTNAMEBupyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd > c:\temp\scriptbup.ps1 
6) cd to temp and run .\scriptbup.ps1 
7) Delete the scriptbup.ps1 file
8) copy the modlist file to ~\_KO\ModList 

Note: To enable running scripts in powershell:
	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

06/21 (R) 
	- Created project directory 
	- Created POA     
	- Created TFE Input Analysis.txt
	- Created Git repository
	- Added ArgTools source code
	- Established TheoVI working folder

06/22 
	- Created app entry point and stub of core class 
	- Added command line args -infile and -outdir 

06/28
	- Added to verify file method, still a WIP (outputs zeros for each segment type) 

06/29
	- Diag on issue w/ verify file failing, traced to input file encoded in UTF-16, python match works with UTF-8


==== Activity Log - 201807 ====

07/03
	- Modified powershell command to produce UTF8 instead of UTF16 LE files.

07/14
	- Added genscript action with output to screen.
	
==== Activity Log - 201808 ====

08/03
	- Modified doGenScript()'s baseCommandString string to use xcopy w/ hack to answer directory or file prompt
	- Modified getFilenameFromLine() technique for extracting filenames to accomodate names with spaces 

08/24
	- Test run shows script output generates an error message for each xcopy line, "Invalid number of parameters"
	- Using .ps1 files as script output instead of .bat, no error message. 
	- Created process steps (see above) 
	- Ran for months 5,6,7 and 8 to 8/24.

==== Activity Log - 201812 ====

12/08
	- Updated instructions to include new laptop source in examples and instructions for enabling script running in powershell.
	
12/21
	- Updated TheFileEngine.py print statements to use print() with parenthesis.
	
==== Activity Log - 201903 ====

03/01
	- Changes to mod list file format

> In-Progress 
	

> Next: 
	- Expand genscript action to output to a file
	- Add code to test use of import OS and shutil for file copy operations 0622
