S1 POA - The File Engine 

Goal - Create a python app that copies files found in a powershell produce text file backup.

>Reference 
------------
File produced from powershell script as follows:
dir -recurse | ? {$_.lastwritetime -gt '1/1/19' -AND $_.lastwritetime -lt '6/30/19 23:59:59'} | out-file -encoding UTF8 c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt
	Note: For current period, use tomorrow's date for -lt parameter.
	Note: Obsolete version produced UTF16 LE file encoding, causing issues with python code reading the file.

NOTE: When cascading backups, use earliest capture date from upstream backup to avoid dropping files between cascade steps.

Process (in powershell):
0) Create target bup folder c:\temp\BupHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd 
1) cd to source folder, Run above 'dir -recurse...' command, output to c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt 
2) Search for NewFolder.txt, indicates files may have been moved that do not have modified dates.
3) Search for NoArchive.txt file, remove folders containing this (m/b too big) 
4) cd to TFE project directory, source folder. 
5) Run python tfe.py -action genscript -infile c:\temp\modlistHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd.txt -targetpath c:\temp\BupHOSTNAMEyyyymmdd_yyyymmdd > c:\temp\scriptbup.ps1 
6) cd to temp and run .\scriptbup.ps1 
7) Delete the scriptbup.ps1 file
8) copy the modlist file to ~\_KO\ModList 

Note: To enable running scripts in powershell:
	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

	May need to also (or in lieu of the above): Unblock-File .\gencmds.ps1

06/21 (R) 
	- Created project directory 
	- Created POA     
	- Created TFE Input Analysis.txt
	- Created Git repository
	- Added ArgTools source code
	- Established TheoVI working folder

06/22 
	- Created app entry point and stub of core class 
	- Added command line args -infile and -outdir 

06/28
	- Added to verify file method, still a WIP (outputs zeros for each segment type) 

06/29
	- Diag on issue w/ verify file failing, traced to input file encoded in UTF-16, python match works with UTF-8


==== Activity Log - 201807 ====

07/03
	- Modified powershell command to produce UTF8 instead of UTF16 LE files.

07/14
	- Added genscript action with output to screen.
	
==== Activity Log - 201808 ====

08/03
	- Modified doGenScript()'s baseCommandString string to use xcopy w/ hack to answer directory or file prompt
	- Modified getFilenameFromLine() technique for extracting filenames to accomodate names with spaces 

08/24
	- Test run shows script output generates an error message for each xcopy line, "Invalid number of parameters"
	- Using .ps1 files as script output instead of .bat, no error message. 
	- Created process steps (see above) 
	- Ran for months 5,6,7 and 8 to 8/24.

09/28
	- Updated commonly overlooked placeholder text (outputdir vs temp)

==== Activity Log - 201812 ====
11/22
	- Updated instructions

12/08
	- Updated instructions to include new laptop source in examples and instructions for enabling script running in powershell.
	
12/21
	- Updated TheFileEngine.py print statements to use print() with parenthesis.

12/22
	- Updated syntax to Python 3.7
	- Updated instructions for modlist preservation.

==== Activity Log - 2019 ====

01/05 
 	- Updated dir sample to use 2019 dates

02/23 
	- Updated instructions for cascading backups and including host name in mod list

03/01
	- Changes to mod list file format

03/23 
 	- Changed bup folder name structure, now consistent w/ modlist filename

04/01 
	- Minor title update (testing checkin from a diff client) 

04/06	
	- Updated activity log with detail from check-in comments 
	- Modified process steps, removed check for .PST and renumbered list 
	- Corrected filename pattern in python run step 

> In-Progress 
	

> Next: 
	- Expand genscript action to output to a file
	- Add code to test use of import OS and shutil for file copy operations 0622
